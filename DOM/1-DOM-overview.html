DOM
=========
DOM stands for document object model. 
DOM describes how HTML document works and how Java script can interact with HTML and dynamically change the contents of HTML document.
In HTML DOM all elements are represented as objects.
Java script can dynamically change the contents of the HTLM page by interacting with the DOM objects.
All the DOM objects have corresponding methods and properties.

Java script can change
    - elements
    - attributes
    - css styles
    - remove HTLM elements
    - add HTML elements
    - react to HTML events
    - create HTML events

DOM Objects, methods and properties
===================================
DOM objects have methods and properties like any other objects.
Using these methods and objects javascript can interact with HTML elements.
HTLM DOM can be accessed with java script and other languages as well. Our focus is only on javascript.

methods - these are the actions that can be performed on HTLM elements.
